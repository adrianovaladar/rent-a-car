Welcome to the Rent-a-Car Management System! This application is designed to manage customers, vehicles, and rental contracts for a portuguese car rental service.

It was originally developed at [ISEP](https://www.isep.ipp.pt) and was fully refactored later on.

## Features
### Customer Management
- Add new customers;
- Manage existing customers by their unique codes;
- Display  customer data.
### Vehicle Management
- Add new vehicles;
- Manage vehicles by their unique codes;
- Display vehicle data;
- Display the location of the vehicles.

### Contract Management
- Create new rental contracts;
- Manage contracts by vehicle code and start date;
- Display rental contract data.

## Requirements
- Operating System: Windows or Linux.

## Installation
### Clone the repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rent-a-car.git
$ cd rent-a-car
```

### Compile the project:

```
$ cmake .
$ make
```

### Run the executable:

```
$ ./rent_a_car
```
### Another Approach: Dockerfile (for Linux)

#### Build the docker image

First, build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile:

    $ docker build -t rent-a-car .

This command will create a Docker image tagged as rent-a-car.

#### Run the application

Once the image is built, run the app inside a Docker container:

    $ docker run -it -v ~/rent_a_car_files:/usr/src/app/files -v ~/rent_a_car_files/logs:/usr/src/app/logs rent-a-car

This command does the following:

- -it: Runs the container interactively with a terminal;
- -v ~/rent_a_car_files:/usr/src/app/files: Mounts the rent_a_car_files directory from your local machine (in your home directory)
  to /usr/src/app/files inside the container.
  This provides persistent storage of the data;
- -v ~/rent_a_car_files/logs:/usr/src/app/logs: This allows the application to save logs that can be useful for debugging and
  issue tracking;
- rent-a-car: Specifies the Docker image to use.

## Usage
Once you start the application, you'll be greeted with a simple menu. Just enter the number corresponding to what you'd like to do.

Hereâ€™s what the menu looks like:
